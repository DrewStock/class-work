===

## Kickoff
* Welcome to campus and to being a developer!
* Goal for this class:
    * Ready for hire at 1-2 years experience
* Intros
    * My background
    * Students & TA's:
        * name & your relationship with JavaScript
* Facility information
    * News as we know on new space
* Events, class study groups, other social... 

## 401 Student Expectations Background:
* Go beyond getting it to work...
* Why is software development so hard?
    * known vs unknown problems
* Emphasis on Refactoring and Code Improvement
* Trade-off decisions over right/wrong
* “Growth Mindset” Learning and Self Awareness
* We value:
    * Collaboration with team members and business
    * Maintainable code (quality and comprehension)
* Active communication about coding when collaborating
    * 401 students don't say "it doesn't work"
    * What information exists? 
    * What does work? 
    * When did it stop working? 
    * What could you try to generate more information? 
    * One of the best ways to practice is through collaborative work...
* Purpose of pairing/collaborative exercises is to practice communication skills
* (pairing accelerates learning)
* Mindset software development team, not academic course work
    * "mixed" skill level
        * takes a variety of skill
        * more senior? lift teammate up, learn more by teaching
        * less senior? voice questions, raise issues, by senior in other areas
* Uphold Code of Conduct - Be Kind
* Make sure everyone has equally has opportunity to:
    * Speak, Ideate, and Lead

## 401 Student Expectations:
* Evidence of Refactoring and Code Improvement
* No cut-n-paste of other's code - Kinesthetic Learning
* Own your repo
* Unless explicitly mentioned otherwise, labs can be done collaboratively
* Develop your development as a developer, holistically
* Call out jargon
* Ask to repeat, clarify, cover again...

Questions?

## Course Overview
* 10 week overview

## CS concepts
* Provide [models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_models_are_wrong) for learning
* Turtles on turtles all the way down...
* Goal is contextual understanding

## This week in JavaScript...

### ES New langage features

ES6? ES2015? WAT?

Things we'll probably run into:
* `const`/`let`
* arrow functions
* default parameters
* `class`
* destructuring

### Core Advanced topics we'll cover this week.
* By Ref vs By Val
	* basic memory concepts
* Functions
	* as objects
	* closures
	* “this”
	* bind, call, apply
* Objects
	* Prototypical inheritance
	* constructor functions vs Object.create
	* ES6 “class”
	* Revealing Module pattern
	* Object Literals
* Array Methods
	* “Functional” - forEach, map, filter, reduce, etc.
	* “modifying” - sort, length, etc.
	* Chaining 
	* ES6 fat arrow ftw!
* Javascript Literals
	* Object
	* Array
	* Regex
	* string, number, bool, hex, ...

## Today's Learning Objectives
* Setup and run JavaScript “app” using Node.js from command line
	* `node --version` > 6
	* Debug
* Basic `node` architecture 101
	* v8 + event-loop + os-lib
	* Process - OS manage computation time
	* Thread - actual "thread of execuation"
	* Event loop explained
* JavaScript single threaded event model
* Logically organize and split code into modules (.js files) 
using require and module.exports to share code between modules 
(we'll cover import and export in second half of course) 
* Use tests and assertions to validate and maintain correctness of code
* Command line use of `mocha`: run, and watch (continuously run) tests
* Heap v Stack Memory
